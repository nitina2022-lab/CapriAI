The primary tool we use is Bank Rate . This is the interest rate we pay on deposits placed with us overnight by eligible firms such as commercial banks.\n\nAdditionally, when required, we can buy bonds to bring down long-term interest rates on savings and loans through quantitative easing (QE) .\n\nWhat we use monetary policy for\n\nMonetary policy affects how much prices are rising – called the rate of inflation. We set monetary policy to achieve low and stable inflation. This is our primary monetary policy objective.\n\nIn practice, this means keeping inflation at 2% over the medium term, which is the target set for us by the Government .\n\nSubject to this primary objective, we also support the Government’s other economic aim, which is strong, sustainable and balanced growth.\n\nLatest and upcoming MPC dates\n\nHow we decide what action to take\n\nOur Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decides what monetary policy action to take. The MPC sets and announces policy eight times a year (roughly once every six weeks).\n\nThe MPC has nine individual members . Before they decide what action to take, they hold several meetings to look at how the economy is working.\n\nIt can take around 18 – 24 months for monetary policy to have its full effect on the economy. So MPC members need to consider what inflation and growth in the economy are likely to be in the next few years.\n\nWe explain the reasons behind our monetary policy decisions (for example to raise or lower interest rates) in our quarterly Monetary Policy Report and in the published minutes of each MPC meeting.\n\nGlossary\n\nMonetary Policy Committee meetings\n\nWe publish the dates the MPC will make announcements on monetary policy in advance. In the week leading up to each announcement, the committee meets several times.\n\nPre-MPC meeting\n\nFirst meeting\n\nSecond meeting\n\nFinal meeting\n\nThe Governor recommends the policy he believes will be supported by the majority of MPC members, and the members vote. The meeting usually is on the Wednesday, the day before the announcement.\n\nEach individual member gets a vote, and the decision is based on the policy with a majority of votes. If there is a tie, the Governor casts the deciding vote. Any member in a minority is asked to say what stance of policy they would have preferred.\n\nMPC announcement\n\nWe publish the MPC’s decision with the minutes of the meetings at 12 noon on the day of the announcement, which is usually a Thursday.\n\nWe publish rate announcem"}
