Repayments will vary depending on the property purchase price, your deposit amount and the rate you choose.\n\nWhat is a mortgage repayment?\n\nA mortgage repayment is a payment to a lender to pay back the money borrowed to buy a house or property. Mortgage repayments are typically paid monthly.\n\nRepresentative example\n\nWhat do the numbers mean?\n\nInterest rate : This is the interest rate you’ll pay for the initial period of 2 or 5 years. It’s either fixed or variable (tracker).\n\nMonthly payment : If you started your mortgage today, this is the amount you would pay each month for a set period of time, usually 2 or 5 years.\n\nLoan to value (LTV) : This is the size of the mortgage compared to the value of the property. For example, if a house is valued at £100,000 and you have a deposit of £10,000, the LTV is 90%.\n\nTotal cost : This is the total cost you’ll pay for the first, usually 2 or 5 years, of your mortgage, depending on the mortgage you choose. If the mortgage has a product fee, this is included and assumes it’s paid upfront.\n\nProduct fee : It’s a fee charged as part of the mortgage. It can be paid upfront or added to the total mortgage amount. If you add it to your mortgage balance, you’ll pay interest on it at the same rate as the rest of your mortgage until the mortgage is paid off.\n\nNeed some help?"}
