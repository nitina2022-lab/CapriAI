That's why we've listed some common mortgage terms here.\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV)\n\nThis represents the percentage of the property value you want to borrow. For example, a £100,000 property with an £80,000 mortgage would be an 80% LTV. The maximum LTV we'll lend you depends on your individual situation, the property, the loan you choose and the amount you borrow.\n\nInitial interest rate This is the initial percentage rate at which we calculate the interest on the mortgage.\n\nVariable rate When your initial mortgage rate ends, the interest on your mortgage will be calculated using the HSBC Standard Variable Rate or HSBC Buy to Let Variable rate. This will vary over the term of the loan and is set internally. HSBC Standard Variable Rate and HSBC Buy to Let Variable Rate do not track the Bank of England base rate.\n\nInitial interest rate period This is the period during which the fixed or tracker rate applies. For fixed and tracker rate mortgages, when the specified period expires, the rate will revert to the HSBC Standard Variable Rate/Buy-to-let Variable Rate.\n\nAnnual Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC) The APRC represents the overall cost for comparison and can be used to compare mortgages.\n\nBooking fee A fee charged on some mortgages to secure a particular mortgage deal.\n\nAnnual overpayment allowance (AOA)\n\nYou'll have an annual overpayment allowance for fixed-rate mortgages equivalent to 10% of the outstanding balance of your mortgage. This is calculated annually on the date your fixed-rate period started. You can make additional paymen"}
