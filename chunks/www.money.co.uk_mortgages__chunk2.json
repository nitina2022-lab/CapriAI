This means your mortgage repayments won’t go up or down for the duration of your fixed-rate. This is very useful when it comes to budgeting as you’ll know what your mortgage payments will be for the duration of your deal.\n\nHowever, if the Bank of England base rate drops during your fixed-rate period, you won’t benefit from lower interest rates.\n\nYou can get a 2-year fix , 5-year fix or 10-year fix , but there are also deals that last 1, 3, 7 or longer than 10 years.\n\nVariable-rate mortgages\n\nA variable-rate mortgage has an interest rate that can go up or down. This means your repayments could change throughout the course of your mortgage. A variable-rate mortgage might be cheaper than a fixed-rate one initially but could end up being more expensive overall.\n\nVariable-rate options include discounted and tracker mortgages, as well as standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages.\n\nTracker mortgages\n\nA tracker mortgage tracks the Bank of England base rate by a set amount. For example, you might get a tracker mortgage that is set to track at two percentage points above the base rate.\n\nThis means when the base rate rises or falls, your interest rate will rise or fall with it at two percentage points. So for example, if the base rate rises to 3%*, you pay interest at 5%.\n\n* for demonstration purposes only, the UK base rate is currently 4%\n\nDiscounted mortgages\n\nA discounted mortgage offers an interest rate at a set amount below the lender's standard variable rate (SVR).\n\nThis means it will fall and rise with your lender's SVR, but will remain the set amount cheaper throughout your initial deal. This discount can be in place for a fixed period or for the lifetime of the mortgage.\n\nKirsty Lacey, Mortgage Expert at Mojo Mortgages, said:\n\n“It’s important to understand the difference between a discounted rate and a fixed rate mortgage.
