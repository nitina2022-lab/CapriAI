This means you own your home outright.\n\nInterest-only repayment\n\nAn interest-only mortgage means you only pay off the interest of your mortgage. This makes the monthly repayments much lower, but it's important to be aware that you won't be reducing the overall debt you owe.\n\nWhen the mortgage term ends, you'll still owe the full amount of the mortgage loan.\n\nVery few lenders offer interest-only mortgages, with the vast majority only offering repayment mortgages to residential homes. A repayment mortgage means you'll make monthly payments for an agreed period of time until you've paid back the capital (loan amount), plus interest.\n\nHowever, many buy-to-let mortgages are interest-only as you're purchasing a property that you intend to let out. Lenders base buy-to-let mortgage loans on the potential rental income. It's preferred to offer an interest-only mortgage as the lower monthly payments keep business costs low.\n\nYou could also get an retirement interest-only mortgage if you're an older borrower . This is where you make monthly interest payments but the full loan gets paid off when you die, move into long term care, or sell your house.\n\nMortgage repayment types\n\nWhat affects your mortgage rate?\n\nYour mortgage rates are based on a variety of factors, such as:\n\nCredit score - Make sure you're consistently paying off any outstanding debt on time to prove to the mortgage lender that you can keep on top of monthly repayments. You can also build up your credit score by avoiding applying for other forms of credit and making sure you've registered to vote.\n\nCredit score - Make sure you're consistently paying off any outstanding debt on time to prove to the mortgage lender that you can keep on top of monthly repayments.

The best rates are usually offered around 60% LTV.\n\nDeposit amount and loan to value (LTV) ratio - A bigger deposit means a lower LTV ratio, as a result you'll have higher equity in the property which is deemed as lower risk for mortgage lenders.
