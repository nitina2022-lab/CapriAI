Our review is part of our 5-year strategy , which sets out to support growth and help consumers navigate their financial lives. It also forms part of the work announced in our letter to the Prime Minister to support home ownership and the UK economy.\n\nRegulatory and industry reforms have raised mortgage lending standards. This has led to a more resilient market, with fewer people in arrears and our rules helping consumers in financial difficulty get the support needed for their individual circumstances. But this more cautious approach may also have restricted some creditworthy consumers' access to the market.\n\nHow this affects firms\n\nWe want to make sure the sector is ready to support consumers with the options they need.\n\nWith the introduction of the Consumer Duty providing higher standards of protection for consumers, firms have the flexibility to help more people become homeowners and we’re encouraging them to use it.\n\nBelow are the changes and communications we’ve made so far, and what these mean for firms.\n\nWe reminded lenders of flexibility in our existing stress test rule, to help more people access the affordable mortgage they need.\n\nFirms have flexibility to design their test in a way that is appropriate for the customer's mortgage.\n\nRead further information on how these flexibilities should be applied.\n\nOur Discussion Paper launched a public conversation on the future of the UK mortgage market.\n\nIt considers areas where changes may be needed to support home ownership and economic growth.\n\nWe ask if there are areas where introducing further flexibility in our rules could allow firms to innovate and tailor their product offerings to meet consumers' evolving needs.\n\nWe also ask about areas where there may be scope to rebalance risk appetite to improve access to mortgages.\n\nWe’ve made changes to our rules to support greater choice in the mortgage market. These make it easier for consumers to:\n\nremortgage with a new lender\n\nreduce their mortgage term\n\nspeak to a mortgage adviser about their mortgage needs\n\nFirms can now:\n\nmake use of the modified affordability assessment when the mortgage product a new lender can offer is more affordable than the new mortgage product with the current lender\n\nreduce the term of a customers mortgage term without needing to complete a full affordability assessment\n\ninteract with their customers without this automatically triggering the need to provide regulated advice\n\nWhile these changes are voluntary, we encourage firms to use these flexibilities these allow to broaden access for consumers.\n\nFollowing the Financial Policy Committee’s Recommendation "}
