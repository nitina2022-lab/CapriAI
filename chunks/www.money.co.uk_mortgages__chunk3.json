This discount can be in place for a fixed period or for the lifetime of the mortgage.\n\nKirsty Lacey, Mortgage Expert at Mojo Mortgages, said:\n\n“It’s important to understand the difference between a discounted rate and a fixed rate mortgage. While a discounted rate often appears cheaper at first, this is a variable rate so it’s subject to change throughout your deal, meaning it could increase or decrease at any time.\n\nA fixed rate deal might seem more expensive at first, but you’ll have peace of mind that your payments won’t increase during the length of your deal.”\n\nStandard variable rate (SVR) mortgages\n\nIf you have a fixed, discounted or tracker mortgage that is coming to the end of its initial period, you will move onto your lender’s SVR.\n\nThis will usually be more expensive, as you'll be paying the lender's default rate, by your lender. If you don’t want to move onto your lender's SVR after your initial deal ends, you should consider remortgaging to a new deal.\n\nBeing on an SVR does offer a greater amount of flexibility than some other deals, with no ERCs to pay, which might be helpful if you're planning to move soon. However, you can sometimes get other deals (such as tracker mortgages) that offer no ERCs which may offer better rates. A broker can help you find the right deal for your and your circumstances.\n\nOffset mortgages\n\nOffset mortgages allow you to use your savings to reduce the amount of interest you pay on your mortgage. The money in your savings is offset against the money you've borrowed.\n\nFor example, if you have borrowed £200,000 for your mortgage, but you have £25,000 in savings, you will only pay interest on £175,000.\n\nYou can still access your savings and withdraw your money, but you won't save as much on mortgage interest due to the lower amount in your account.\n\nThis means offset mortgages are generally only beneficial if you save more in the interest you would be paying on your mortgage, than you would be making on your savings.\n\nYour savings account must be with the same bank or building society as your lender.\n\nOffset mortgages can be either fixed or variable rate deals.\n\nTypes of mortgage rates\n\nMortgage repayment types\n\nCapital repayment\n\nA capital repayment mortgage means you pay off the interest payment and a bit of the loan amount you've borrowed each month.\n\nThe amount which you owe will get smaller when you make a repayment each month, until eventually you reach the end of your term and become mortgage-free. This means you own your home outright.\n\nInterest-only repayment\n\nAn interest-only mortgage means you only pay off the interest of your mortgage. This makes the monthly repayments much lower, but it's im"}
