Later life mortgages

Whether you're looking to pay off an existing mortgage, or to release some equity from your home to spend on yourself, your home or your family, one of our later life mortgages could help

What is a later life mortgage?

Our later life mortgages are aimed at homeowners aged 55 (or 50 for our Payment Term Lifetime Mortgage) or over and allow you to borrow money based on the value of your home, while continuing to live there.

Our later life mortgages include Lifetime Mortgages and a Retirement Interest Only Mortgage.

Lifetime mortgage

A type of equity release.

A lifetime mortgage is a loan secured against your home. There’s no need to make monthly payments, unless you choose a Payment Term Lifetime Mortgage, where you have to pay the interest off monthly for an agreed payment term. As a last resort, your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up with payments on the Payment Term Lifetime Mortgage.

The amount borrowed and the added interest aren't usually repaid until you die or move out of the home into long-term care. However, there may be cheaper ways to borrow money.

Retirement Interest Only Mortgage

A type of residential mortgage.

A Retirement Interest Only Mortgage is a loan secured against your home. You have to pay the interest off monthly, but the full amount of the loan isn't usually repaid until you die or move out of the home into long-term care. As a last resort, your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments.

If you're looking to release some money from your home to pay off an existing mortgage, this is one of the options available to you.

"We started to look at lifetime mortgages as we realised there was real advantage in being able to help our children. We have a lot of money tied up in the house and it was a way of releasing that money for better lives for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren." - John and June, Oxfordshire
