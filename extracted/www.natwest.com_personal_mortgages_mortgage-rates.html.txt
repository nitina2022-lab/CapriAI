Common questions about mortgage rates

What is a mortgage interest rate?

A mortgage interest rate is a percentage fee charged on a mortgage loan by a lender – effectively the ‘cost’ of borrowing the money (plus any other applicable fees). You can learn more about how mortgage interest rates work .

Are mortgage rates going up?

Mortgage lenders consider a range of factors when deciding what interest rates they can offer. We can't say for sure if our rates will rise or fall in the future, and we also can't speak for rates offered by other lenders.

Can mortgage interest rates change?

Yes, the interest rates in this tool are subject to change. If you apply for a mortgage with us, you will need to choose from the mortgage interest rates available on the day of your application.

Your mortgage interest rate can also change if you already have a mortgage, unless you currently have a fixed rate deal. You can learn more about what can cause mortgage interest rates to change .

What are the different types of mortgage interest rate?

There are various different types of mortgage interest rates, including fixed rate mortgages and tracker rate mortgages . Learn about them and other types of mortgage interest rates on our mortgage comparison webpage.

What is a product fee?

It's a fee charged as part of the mortgage. It can be paid upfront or added to the total mortgage amount. If you add it to your mortgage balance, you'll pay interest on it at the same rate as the rest of your mortgage until the mortgage is paid off.

How can I work out my mortgage repayments?

Our rates tool can act as a mortgage repayment calculator to help you to work out roughly what your monthly payments may be, depending on the rate you select. Repayments will vary depending on the property purchase price, your deposit amount and the rate you choose.

What is a mortgage repayment?

A mortgage repayment is a payment to a lender to pay back the money borrowed to buy a house or property. Mortgage repayments are typically paid monthly.

Representative example

What do the numbers mean?

Interest rate : This is the interest rate you’ll pay for the initial period of 2 or 5 years. It’s either fixed or variable (tracker).

Monthly payment : If you started your mortgage today, this is the amount you would pay each month for a set period of time, usually 2 or 5 years.

Loan to value (LTV) : This is the size of the mortgage compared to the value of the property. For example, if a house is valued at £100,000 and you have a deposit of £10,000, the LTV is 90%.

Total cost : This is the total cost you’ll pay for the first, usually 2 or 5 years, of your mortgage, depending on the mortgage you choose. If the mortgage has a product fee, this is included and assumes it’s paid upfront.

Product fee : It’s a fee charged as part of the mortgage. It can be paid upfront or added to the total mortgage amount. If you add it to your mortgage balance, you’ll pay interest on it at the same rate as the rest of your mortgage until the mortgage is paid off.
